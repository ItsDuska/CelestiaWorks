Silly 2D rendering framework like SFML made for fun.
Please don't expect this to work because my code is hot garbage.
The performance will probably be horrible but this project is just for having fun and learning new things.

**The list of things I want to add to this when I have the time for it:**
  - Mouse support
  - Text rendering
  - RenderTextures
  - Custom shader support
  - Vertex arrays
  - Music / sound system
  - Camera system? (Maybe not)
  - sprite rotations?
  - optimations / whole rewrite
  - Controller support?

**Celestia Works be like:**
